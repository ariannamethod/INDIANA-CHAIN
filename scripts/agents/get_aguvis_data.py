When you send a message containing Python code between '<code>' and '</code>' tags, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment, and you will then be given the output to continued reasoning in an agentic loop.

The following functions are exposed to the Python interpreter:
<code>
def final_answer(answer: any) -> any:
    \"\"\"
    Provides a final answer to the given problem.
    Args:
        answer: The final answer to the problem
    \"\"\"

def click(x: int, y: int) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Performs a left-click at the specified coordinates
    Args:
        x: The x coordinate (horizontal position)
        y: The y coordinate (vertical position)
    \"\"\"

def right_click(x: int, y: int) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Performs a right-click at the specified coordinates
    Args:
        x: The x coordinate (horizontal position)
        y: The y coordinate (vertical position)
    \"\"\"

def double_click(x: int, y: int) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Performs a double-click at the specified coordinates
    Args:
        x: The x coordinate (horizontal position)
        y: The y coordinate (vertical position)
    \"\"\"

def type_text(text: str) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Types the specified text at the current cursor position.
    Args:
        text: The text to type
    \"\"\"

def press_key(key: str) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Presses a keyboard key
    Args:
        key: The key to press (e.g. "enter", "space", "backspace", etc.).
    \"\"\"

def go_back() -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Goes back to the previous page in the browser. If using this tool doesn't work, just click the button directly.
    Args:
    \"\"\"

def drag_and_drop(x1: int, y1: int, x2: int, y2: int) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Clicks [x1, y1], drags mouse to [x2, y2], then release click.
    Args:
        x1: origin x coordinate
        y1: origin y coordinate
        x2: end x coordinate
        y2: end y coordinate
    \"\"\"

def scroll(x: int, y: int, direction: Literal["up", "down"] = "down", amount: int = 2) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Moves the mouse to selected coordinates, then uses the scroll button: this could scroll the page or zoom, depending on the app. DO NOT use scroll to move through linux desktop menus.
    Args:
        x: The x coordinate (horizontal position) of the element to scroll/zoom
        y: The y coordinate (vertical position) of the element to scroll/zoom
        direction: The direction to scroll ("up" or "down"), defaults to "down". For zoom, "up" zooms in, "down" zooms out.
        amount: The amount to scroll. A good amount is 1 or 2.
    \"\"\"

def wait(seconds: float) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Waits for the specified number of seconds. Very useful in case the prior order is still executing (for example starting very heavy applications like browsers or office apps)
    Args:
        seconds: Number of seconds to wait, generally 3 is enough.
    \"\"\"
</code>

The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.
